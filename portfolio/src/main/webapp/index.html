                My name is Aaron Hamilton, an aspiring Software Engineer and Computer Science major at the California State University of San Marcos. I am passionate about utilizing Computer Science and programming as a method of creation and turning my ideas into realities. My goal is to utilize this knowledge to come up and create applications that will benefit society.

                During my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, learning new things, and spending time with my family/friends. I chose to pursue Computer Science back in middle school after playing one of my favorite video games of all time. It inspired me to where I googled how one could become a part and even create such a game on their own, this is where I stumbled upon Computer Sciencce and decided to dedicate myself to this path.
